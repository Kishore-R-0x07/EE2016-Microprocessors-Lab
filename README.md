# EE2016-Microprocessors-Lab
Assembly and C Language Programs for EE2016 Lab Session at IITM in Fall 2021

These are my solutions for the below mentioned Q's

Lab 1 (Microchip Studio : AVR Atmega8):<br>
Q1) Simple 8-bit Addition <br>
Q2) 16-bit Addition in an 8-bit Processor<br>
Q3) Implement 8-bit Multiplication without inbuilt MUL command<br>
Q4) Given an Array of numbers, Finding the Largest Number<br>

Lab 2 (Microchip Studio : AVR Atmega8):<br>
To demonstrate:<br>
1) External Interrupts triggered by INT0, INT1 pins using AVR Assembly Language<br>
2) External Interrupts triggered by INT0, INT1 pins using C Programming Language<br>
By blinking an LED connected to pin PB0 with a 1 second delay (approximate)<br><br>
Bonus Q: Use the 16 bit timer : Timer 1 to create an accurate 1 second delay for blinking the LED
